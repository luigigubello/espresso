# Espresso ðŸ¤Œ

**Espresso** is a service designed to identify potential phishing websites deployed via PhaaS (phishing-as-a-service) platforms. Espresso should be able to bypass Cloudflare captcha and detection evasions, providing the creation date of the domain, the domain registrar, and a screenshot.

## Detection evasion techniques

The following techniques have been found in the phishing websites deployed through three PhaaS platforms identified in the last year: [Caffeine](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/caffeine-phishing-service-platform), [Greatness](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-phishing-as-a-service-tool-greatness-already-seen-in-the-wild/), and [W3ll](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/w3ll-phishing-report/).

### Cloudflare captcha

Cloudflare is the first and the strongest level of defense implemented by the last-generation PhaaS platforms for their phishing sites. Cloudflare captcha can block many third-party services and scanners used to evaluate fraudulent websites, making it harder for detection systems to flag them. 

Cloudflare works really well to block requests from non-ISP IP addresses (e.g. hosting, VPN, etc) and command-line tools.

### Selenium evasion

If a detection system is able to bypass Cloudflare captcha but it runs Selenium - or other automations - to open the suspicious website, a Javascript code designed to detect Selenium browsers will redirect the client to the legitimate site `bing.com`, instead of the phishing page.

**Code**

```
<a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=e7189ccad17d2346JmltdHM9MTY4ODc3NDQwMCZpZ3VpZD0zZjFkNGZjZi1iYjMyLTYxNDQtMTNmMS01ZDczYmE2ODYwMGEmaW5zaWQ9NTE4OQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=3f1d4fcf-bb32-6144-13f1-5d73ba68600a&amp;psq=office&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2ZmaWNlLmNvbS8&amp;ntb=1" id="cnuDKmJliL" hidden=""></a>
<script>(screen.width>480&&navigator.mimeTypes.length+navigator.plugins.length===0||Array.from(navigator.plugins).some(e=>e.name.includes("Native Client"))||!0===navigator.webdriver||window.document.documentElement.getAttribute("webdriver")||window.callPhantom||window._phantom||window.chrome&&window.chrome.webstore||window.navigator.languages&&window.navigator.languages.includes("webdriver")||"function"==typeof window.webdriver&&window.webdriver.toString().includes("class WebDriver")||window.Capabilities&&window.Capabilities.chrome||window.document.documentElement.getAttribute("webdriver-eval-executed"))&&document.getElementById("cnuDKmJliL").click();</script>
```

The conditions checked by the script include:

- **screen.width > 480:** It checks if the screen width is greater than 480 pixels, which might be an attempt to distinguish between desktop and mobile devices.
- **Browser plugin and MIME type checks:** It checks if the browser has no MIME types and no plugins installed or if it includes the "Native Client" plugin.
- **navigator.webdriver:** It checks if the navigator.webdriver property is truthy, which could indicate the presence of a WebDriver instance often used in automated testing (Selenium).
- **window.document.documentElement.getAttribute("webdriver"):** It checks if an HTML element attribute named "webdriver" is set (Selenium).
- **window.callPhantom, window._phantom:** It checks if certain properties related to the PhantomJS headless browser are present.
- **window.chrome.webstore:** It checks if the `window.chrome.webstore` property is present, which might be an attempt to detect Chrome's web store.
- **window.navigator.languages:** It checks if the browser reports the list of languages supported by the user.
- **window.navigator.languages.includes("webdriver"):** It checks if the list of supported languages includes "webdriver" (Selenium).
- **typeof window.webdriver === "function":** It checks if the `window.webdriver` property is a function and if its string representation includes "class WebDriver" (Selenium).
- **window.Capabilities.chrome:** It checks if a property named "chrome" exists in the "Capabilities" object.
- **window.document.documentElement.getAttribute("webdriver-eval-executed"):** It checks if an HTML element attribute named "webdriver-eval-executed" is set (Selenium).

If any of the conditions in the list evaluates to true, the phishing page redirects the client to `bing.com`.

### Text obfuscation

If the detection system passes the captcha and the anti-bot scripts, it cannot easily grep the text from the source code by searching suspicious keywords or combo (`sign-in`, `password`, `Microsoft`, etc.). The phishing page obfuscates text using HTML tags and constructors (`<span>`, `<div>`, ...) or images instead of text.

**Code sample**

```
<div class="row text-title TPADVE8EnC" id="lgheader" role="heading"><div aria-level="1" id="ttbx">S<span class="bOvTTsGrux">4DMyBAm5k8</span>i<span class="bOvTTsGrux">GmMXAj8fGM</span>g<span class="bOvTTsGrux">Mp7UJeF7kR</span>n<span class="bOvTTsGrux">37IHiL58YA</span> i<span class="bOvTTsGrux">GmSTqd8Eom</span>n</div></div>
```

## How To Use

Build the Docker image.

```
docker build -t espresso .
```

Launch the server.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it espresso
```

And submit the suspicious URL sending a POST request.

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/scanUrl -d 'https://example.org'
```

The server should return the following JSON:

```
{"url":"https://example.org","url_redirect":"https://example.org/","hostname":"example.org","creation_date":"1995-08-31 04:00:00","registrar":"ICANN","cloudflare":false,"cloudflare_bypass":false,"screenshot":"http://127.0.0.1:8080/example.org_2023-09-23_11:42:51.059291.png","ocr":[["Example Domain",0.9949757033947026],["You may use",0.9785027673399405],["permission:",0.9745552511311801]]}
```

- **url:** it is the submitted URL.
- **url_redirect:** ff there is no redirect, `url` and `url_redirect` match.
- **hostname:** hostname of `url`.
- **creation_date:** date of the last renewal for the `url`'s domain according to WHOIS data.
- **registrar:** domain registrar of the `url`'s domain according to WHOIS data.
- **cloudflare:** `true` if there is a Cloudflare challenge.
- **cloudflare_bypass:** `true` if the client has been able to pass the Cloudflare challenge.
- **screenshot:** URL of the screenshot of the page.
- **ocr:** it returns an array of tuples, containing the extracted strings with high confidence (>0.95)

## FAQs

**Q:** I cannot run the Docker container on Apple Mx.

**A:** Yes. This image can run on `amd64` platform, and not on `arm64`, because otherwise Chrome crashes. But you can still run the server on Apple ARM without containerization, just add these two lines at the bottom of `server.py`:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8080)
```

**Q:** The first build is slow.

**A:** Yes, installing [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) is a slow process, probably I will leave this choice as optional to the user. In addition, I recommend at least 32GB of virtual disk for EasyOCR and its models, and a GPU to optimize EasyOCR.

**Q:** Espresso cannot bypass Cloudflare captcha.

**A:** Yes, this can happen, it's a mouse-n-cat game. Cloudflare captcha uses heuristic metrics to detect non-human actions or automation. They probably evaluate the client configuration (window resoluzion, plugins, etc), the IP (hosting vs. ISP, number of requests, etc), and other unknown metrics. So, if you iterate requests from the same IP, probably Cloudflare will block you.
